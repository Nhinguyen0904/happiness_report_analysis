The correlation between \"Generosity\" and Happiness score appeared to be less pronounced, suggesting that the impact of generosity on happiness isn't very clear.\n* The overall happiness score has increased significantly since 2017 dropping in 2023 but we might see a clearer trend when having a complete dataset at the end of 2023\n* Finland's happiness score saw a substantial increase starting in 2016 and having exhibited the highest score since 2018 and being 5 years in a row being called the happiest country\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis project contributes to our understanding of the multifaceted nature of happiness and the factors that contribute to it. It underscores the importance of considering a range of well-being metrics when assessing and improving the quality of life for individuals and communities worldwide.","metadata":{}}]}
