# World Happiness Data Analysis Project
The purpose of this data analysis project is to explore world happiness data and uncover correlations between key metrics, including life expectancy, freedom, GDP, and overall happiness scores. Additionally, we aim to identify trends in happiness scores across different countries over a decade. With a particular focus on Finland, consistently ranked as the world's happiest country for five consecutive years, we will analyze various datasets.

## Datasets
- World Happiness Report 2013-2023: This dataset provides deep insights into happiness metrics from 2013 to 2023.

- World Happiness Index 2013-2023: This dataset allows us to analyze happiness trends across countries over the entire decade.
